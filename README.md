Efficiency and productivity:By using sytematic methods it helps in reducing development time and costs, enabling faster time to market products.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)-This milestone marked the recognition of software development as a distinct engineering discipline, emphasizing the need for systematic and disciplined approaches to software creation.
2.Introduction of structured Programming(1970s)-Key milestones and innovations that include the development of programming languages( e.g. Fortran,C).This methodology promoted the use of clear, logical structures in code, such as loops and conditionals, to improve readability and maintainability.
3.Agile methodologies in the 2000s- which revolutionized software engineering by promoting flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The software development life Cycle
1.Planning and Requirement analysis-Gathering requirements,documents from stakeholders and analyzing them to understand what softwaree need to achieve and define the goals.
2.Design-Through creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementing-Developers write the code based on the design documents.
4.Testing-ensuring suitability,functions correctly and meets the requirements.
5.Deploying-able to work and release to users
6.Maintanance-updating and improving software over time diffrent versions.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.Sequential approach with distinct phases which documentation is created for each phases.Appropriate scenario Developing a medical device software where regulatory compliance and thorough documentation are critical. .Disadvantages is difficult to accommodate changes once the project is underway and testing occurs late in the development cycle, potentially leading to costly fixes.

Agile-An iterative and flexible approach that emphasizes continuous delivery, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change.Includes planning, development, testing, review, and retrospective in each sprint.Appropriate scenario is creating a new e-commerce platform where customer feedback and market trends drive continuous improvement.Diasavantages it is harder to predict timelines and costs.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) :software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code.Example visual studio,Eclipse
Importance:
Increased Productivity through code editing and navigation and automation of repetitive task
Error detection and prevention through real time error checking and refactoring support.
Customization and extensibility -plugins and extensions that add new features with customize workflows
Integrated tools and features for debugging,version control,build and deployment tools.

Version Control Systems (VCS):software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.Examples Git,subversion
Importance:
Collaboration - VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. By using branches and merging, developers can work on different features or bug fixes in parallel.
Tracking and Auditing-VCS records the history of every change made to the code, including who made the change, when it was made, and why.
Branching and Merging-VCS allows developers to create branches for new features or experimental work without affecting the stability of the main codebase.
Backup and Recovery-VCS serves as a backup for the entire codebase. In case of accidental deletion or corruption, developers can easily restore previous versions of the code.
Global and Distributed Teams-VCS allows teams spread across different locations to collaborate effectively. Distributed VCS like Git enables developers to work offline and sync changes when they reconnect, making it ideal for global teams.






What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.To overcome this one need to priotize task and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
  -Managing Complexity: Software systems can become increasingly complex as they grow, making it difficult to understand, maintain, and extend the codebase to overcome this you need to use modular design,refactoring and use design patterns.
-Handling Changing Requirements:Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.To overcome this one needs to adopt Agile practices, such as iterative development and frequent communication with stakeholders, to accommodate changes more effectively.
-Security Concerns:Ensuring the security of software systems is critical, but it can be challenging to identify and mitigate all potential vulnerabilities.To overcome one need to follow security best practices, such as input validation, encryption, and secure coding standards, to minimize vulnerabilities.
-Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes this can be overcomed by contious learning.






Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing-Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of a software application in isolation from the rest of the system.This helps in early detection of bugs and fix them ensuring code quality and regression prevention.

Integration Testing-focuses on testing the interactions between different units or components of a software application to ensure that they work together correctly. This type of testing is done after unit tests have been completed.Integration testing validates the interfaces between components, ensuring that data is passed correctly and that communication between components is accurate.It helps identify issues that may arise when individual units are combined, such as mismatches in data formats, incorrect method calls, or unhandled exceptions.

 System Testing-Testing the entire software system as a whole.System testing validates the entire software application, including its interactions with external systems, databases, and hardware.It ensures that all functional requirements are met and that the software performs the tasks it was designed to do.
 
 Acceptance Testing -Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing, conducted to determine whether the software is ready for release. It is typically performed by the end-users or clients to ensure that the software meets their needs and requirements.It serves as the final quality check before the software is released to production, helping to identify any last-minute issues that need to be addressed.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in away that helps get the best responses from your robot.
Importance in interacting with AI models:
Optimizing AI Performance:Well-crafted prompts help reduce ambiguity and guide the AI toward more accurate and relevant responses.
Enhancing User Experience:Effective prompt engineering simplifies the interaction between users and AI, making it easier for non-experts to obtain useful results.
Improving Output Quality: Prompt engineering allows users to direct the AI toward specific tasks, such as summarization, translation, coding, or creative writing.
Unlocking Creative and Complex Applications
Mitigating Bias and Ethical Concerns



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

prompt "What is population control"
Improved "The effect of population control in Africa and potential benefits"
The improved prompt is more effective since it can yield a more focused and relevant response to the specific area needed africa while the prompt produces overly general information.
